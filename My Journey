Okay this is my first interaction with GitHub after 9 years. I am hoping to spend an hour everyday using this as a note taking app and continuously updating my notes to understand how GitHub does version control and thus hopefully gain a grasp of what developers do. Wish me luck. 
I have been working with devs for many years, yet never seemed to have understood much of the tools that they use. Now that I work with non-devs I yearn to get back to the tech side of project management since they pay well and job security is better there. Hence starting to add GitHub to my tool list. 
I am not really sure what all to expect from GitHub. As of now I am totally blank. However so far, I have learnt
	1) How to create a repository on the web interface
 2) How to create a file within a repository within the web interface
 3) How to publish the file contents from the web interface. i.e. COMMITTING changes

So this is essentially my first edit on the file. I have created a branch from the main branch. My assumption is that when I commit the changes the original file will continue looking the same. Let's test it out. 

Okay feeling good. Lesson learnt so far:
1) How to create a repository on the web interface
 2) How to create a file within a repository within the web interface
 3) How to publish the file contents from the web interface. i.e. COMMITTING changes
4) You can create a branch and commit and that does NOT affect the main site
5) Only when you create a branch, will you see the option of Pull Request.
6) GitHub allows you to compare what all has changed
7) Github itself will tell you whether there is a Conflict in merging the branches. Need to read a bit about it. But at least in my simplistic example it just compared the text and found that I was not overwriting anything. Got to test that tomorrow.
